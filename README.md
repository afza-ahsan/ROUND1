This is a tarot card themed website for the Lampoon!

The homepage is linked as new.html.
Once you open it, you will ifnd a homepage with 4 buttons. One of those buttons is masthead which will display a pop up to show the masthead. The other button is info which will again display a pop up where info can be added. The button next to that is 'more' which will lead you to the lampoon website to read more articles.

The 4th button is the 'Get a Reading Button' which should redirect you to a chess board loading screen where the lampoon logo is moving in the direction of a horse. Once your cards are drwan, three tarot cards will be flipped in front of you and then moved to the side so you can read the article associated with that tarot card. Once you are done reading an article, you can change the article you are seeing by either clicking the 'Card 2' button or the 'Card 3' button. 

From this page, you can also draw more cards by clicking on the 'Get A New Reading Button' and also go back to the homepage by clicking on the home button.
